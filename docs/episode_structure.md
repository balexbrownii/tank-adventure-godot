# Tank's Great Adventure - Episode Structure

## Game Title
**The Great Adventure: Tank vs. Common Sense**

---

## The Signature Hook

> **"Repair the story while playing it."**

The game is a storybook that is actively falling apart. This is the "I haven't seen this before" differentiator.

### How It Works
- Missing nouns/verbs **drop out of sentences** and become inventory items
- **Paste words back** into the page to unlock doors, calm NPCs, change destinations
- **Rearranging panels** changes geography (Gorogoa-style)
- The **narrator reacts** to your tampering with the text
- You literally "run out of paper" as the story progresses

### Why This Works
Makes the presentation layer into gameplay—highly dynamic without requiring infinite content.

---

## Core Pillars

### 1. The Approach Wheel: Brains / Brawn / Bizarre
Every major obstacle supports 2-3 solutions:

| Approach | Character | Actions | Consequence Style |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| **Brains** | Pig | Craft, bargain, sneak, misdirect | Clean, planned |
| **Brawn** | Tank | Smash, throw, intimidate, martial arts | Often causes new problems |
| **Bizarre** | Narrator/Meta/Tank's luck | UI breaks, page tears, literal idioms, panel rearrangement | Unpredictable but internally logical |

### 2. Party-Based Point-and-Click
Switch characters often—not as a gimmick, but so puzzles feel dynamic.

### 3. Storybook Meta-Interface
- Missing pages
- Rearranged paragraphs
- Clickable sound effects
- Case files as playable objects

### 4. Tone Modulation
Mostly Monkey Island comedy, with short lanes of:
- **Eerie suspense** (werewolf, nighttime)
- **Reflective atmosphere** (raft at midnight, fog, crash aftermath)

---

## Interaction Mode Rotation

The primary loop can't be identical every chapter. Rotate these modes:

| Mode | Description | Inspiration |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Classic Scene Puzzling** | Inventory + dialogue | Monkey Island |
| **Panel Puzzles** | Rearrange story frames | Gorogoa |
| **Case File Puzzling** | Edit/repair narrator's record | Device 6 |
| **Timed Choice Beats** | Rare, for panic comedy | Walking Dead |
| **Set-Piece Puzzles** | Environmental contraptions | Myst |

## The Investigation Loop

Borrowed from Sam & Max's "bizarre but logical" investigation vibe:

```
We need X → Who has X? → What do they want? → Puzzle chain → Got X!
```

Every episode should have at least one clear investigation loop that the player can articulate.

2. **Consequence tracking** - Heat/Morale affect dialogue and options

4. **Collectibles:**
   - "Found footage" videos Tank misinterprets
   - Margin doodles
   - Conspiracy board pieces
5. **Achievements:**
   - "Maximum Tank" (all Brawn solutions)
   - "Pig's Pride" (all Brains solutions)
   - "What Just Happened" (all Bizarre solutions)
   - "Perfectly Balanced" (mix of all three)
