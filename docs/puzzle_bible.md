# Tank's Great Adventure - Room-by-Room Puzzle Bible

## Global Systems

### Tank Vision vs Reality Vision Toggle

A toggle the player can switch any time:

- **Tank Vision:** Mislabeled objects ("MONSTERS" = cars, "LEG VOID" = leaf pile). Reveals Tank-only interactions (heroic nonsense options).
- **Reality Vision:** Correct labels and hidden mechanics (road signs, tags, safety devices). Reveals smart solutions—but risks teaching Tank.

**Key extra verb:** "Tell Tank" (optional). If you tell Tank what something "really is," her future options and reactions change.

### Three Meters (0-100 scale)

| Meter | What It Tracks | Rises When... | Effects |
|-------|----------------|---------------|---------|
| **Heat** | Wanted/pursuit level | Tank causes public chaos | More guards, less NPC cooperation |
| **Ignorance** | Tank's protective cluelessness | You examine in Reality Vision or Tell Tank | Higher = more chaotic options |
| **Morale** | Pig patience + Deer calm | Good choices, team success | Affects hints, dialogue, puzzle options |

### Fail-Forward Rule

No hard dead ends. "Failure" causes:
- A funny setback
- A different inventory outcome
- A slightly harder next room (but still solvable)

---

## ROOM 1 — "Wanted Camp" (Night)

**Story anchor:** Tank is camping and hiding from German soldiers after eating the commander's bacon sandwich.

### Objective
Survive the patrol and leave camp with useful supplies.

### Hotspots
- Wanted Poster (tree/pole)
- Campfire
- Backpack (dirty, stolen)
- Bacon sandwich remnants
- Bush line / tall grass
- River path
- Vine coil
- Rock pile

### Inventory In/Out
- **Gain:** Backpack, Vine, Rock, Bacon Crumbs (comedy "scent" item)
- **Optional gain:** Poster Scrap (later used as "official-looking paper")

### Obstacle: Soldiers arrive ("Tennnn HoouT!!!")

| Solution | Method | Consequence |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Tank (Brawn)** | Click soldiers in combo order: Headlock → Kick → Chop → Toss | Fast exit, Heat +1 |
| **Sneak (Brains)** | Use Bacon Crumbs on bushes to lure, hide behind Rock Pile, slip out | Heat +0, less loot |
| **Trick (Bizarre)** | Tank Vision: soldiers labeled "Bacon Guardians" → "Offer Tribute" (campfire + crumbs) | Escape with style |

### Fail-Forward
If caught: Short "interrogation" vignette where Tank confidently lies ("I'm a tree."). Escape anyway, but lose Poster Scrap.

### Vision Swap Matters
- **Reality Vision:** Reveals patrol pattern (footprints / lantern sweep)
- **Tank Vision:** Reveals "Bacon Guardian" dialogue option

---

## ROOM 2 — "The Werewolf Chase Path"

**Story anchor:** A giant werewolf wants Tank's bacon; she runs, trips on a vine, falls into a ditch.

Escape the werewolf and reach safety (the ditch) while collecting at least one useful item.

### Hotspots
- Split trail sign (crooked branch "arrows")
- Vine tripline
- Hollow log
- Thorn bush
- Mud patch
- Ditch edge

### Inventory In/Out
- **Gain (based on route):** Thorn, Sticky Mud, Hollow Log Bark, or Extra Vine

### Obstacle: "Outrun" encounter (point-and-click chase)

| Solution | Method | Consequence |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Fast Tank (Brawn)** | Click correct sequence: Log → Mud → Ditch | Fastest, drop Bacon Crumbs |
| **Decoy (Brains)** | Use Vine to snap branch, wolf investigates, slip to ditch | Gain Thorn item |
| **Tank Vision Gag (Bizarre)** | Wolf tagged "ARCH NEMESIS" → "Challenge to honorable duel" | Fails hilariously, buys 5 seconds |

### Fail-Forward
Misclick: Tank faceplants into mud. Wolf sneezes (mud up nose). Second chance. Start next room with Mud Face (Morale -1 until washed).

### Vision Swap Matters
- **Reality Vision:** Shows vine is a tripline hazard
- **Tank Vision:** Hides hazard, adds comedy "duel" verb

---

## ROOM 3 — "Ditch Hideout"

- **Optional:** Charcoal Chunk (friction fire smear)

### Obstacle: "Make camp" in the ditch

| Solution | Method | Consequence |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Standard** | Click Leaf pile → "Use as blanket" | Basic |
| **Better (Brains)** | Combine Leaf Blanket + Root Fiber = Leaf Wrap | Better item |
| **Tank (Brawn)** | "Punch the ground to make bed" | Works, Heat +1 (loud) |

### Fail-Forward
No blanket: Tank wakes up "dramatically injured" anyway—she invents suffering. Slower movement until "shake it off."

### Vision Swap Matters
- **Tank Vision:** Leaf pile labeled "LEG VOID"
- **Reality Vision:** "Your leg is under here"

---

## ROOM 4 — "Morning Miracle"

**Story anchor:** Tank realizes her leg is fine when leaves fall off.

- **Gain:** "Miracle Confidence" (temporary buff: Tank attempts bold options first)

### Obstacle: "My leg is gone!"

| Solution | Method | Consequence |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Reality (Brains)** | Examine leaf pile → "Pull off leaves" → leg revealed | Standard |
| **Tank (Brawn)** | Click "Pretend struggle" 3x → falls → leaves scatter | Comedy |
| **Bizarre** | Click "Scream MIRACLE" repeatedly → screen shake → leaves fall | Achievement |

### Fail-Forward
Refuse to interact: Pig teases Tank with flashback later. Miss optional achievement.

### Vision Swap Matters
**This is the "teach the toggle" moment** - labels are wildly different.

---

| Solution | Method | Consequence |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Tank (Ignorance)** | Eat without examining | No harm, Ignorance stays low, keep "invulnerable dumb luck" |
| **Reality (Brains)** | Examine in Reality Vision → discover poison | Can still eat but causes Sick Timer, Ignorance +1 |
| **Bait (Bizarre)** | Don't eat; use food as bait later | Harder next room, more puzzle options |

### Fail-Forward
Tank gets sick: Exaggerated "I'm dying" performance while walking. Quick "find water + sit down" micro-puzzle, then continue.

### Vision Swap Matters
- **Reality Vision:** Reveals poison
- **"Tell Tank":** Permanently changes how similar hazards work later

---

| **Redirect (Brains)** | Use Cone or Rock Chalk to mark "monster nest" away from cars | Heat +0, gain Donut Box |

| **Tank (Brawn)** | Try intimidation | Pig joins grudgingly, Morale -1, unlock "I'm the leader" lines |
