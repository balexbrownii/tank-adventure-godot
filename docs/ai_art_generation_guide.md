## Animation Workflow

### For Smooth Character Animation

1. **Generate base pose** at high resolution
2. **Request frame variations** using same seed/style
3. **Use img2img** to create in-between frames
4. **Maintain consistency** by including character reference in prompt

### Frame Count Guidelines
| Animation | Frames | Loop |
|-----------|--------|------|
| Idle | 4-6 | Yes |
| Walk | 6-8 | Yes |
| Talk | 3-4 | Yes |
| Action (fight, pick up) | 4-8 | No |
| Reaction | 2-4 | No |

---

## Tool Recommendations

### For Backgrounds
- **Midjourney v6** - Best for painterly, detailed backgrounds
- **DALL-E 3** - Good for specific compositions, follows prompts closely
- **Stable Diffusion + ControlNet** - Best for consistency if you have reference images

### For Characters
- **Midjourney** - Good for initial character designs
- **Stable Diffusion** - Better for sprite sheets with consistency
- **Manual cleanup required** - AI struggles with perfect sprite alignment

### For Animation Frames
- **img2img workflows** - Generate variations from base pose
- **Stable Diffusion + LoRA** - Train on character for consistency
- **Manual tweening** - Fill gaps between AI-generated keyframes

### Post-Processing Tools
- **Photoshop/GIMP** - Cleanup, background removal, color correction
- **Aseprite** - Sprite sheet organization, animation preview
- **Remove.bg** - Quick background removal for characters

---

## Consistency Tips

### Maintaining Style Across All Assets

1. **Use the same style suffix** on every prompt:
   ```
   ...1990s LucasArts adventure game style, Monkey Island Special Edition
   aesthetic, hand-painted illustration, warm saturated colors
   ```

2. **Generate in batches** - Do all backgrounds in one session to maintain mood

3. **Create a color palette** - Extract colors from first successful image, reference in future prompts

4. **Character reference** - Once you have approved character design, include cropped reference in all character prompts

5. **Seed locking** (Midjourney/SD) - Use same seed for variations of same scene/character

### Color Palette Reference
```
Primary: Warm browns, oranges, golden yellows (firelight, tropics)
Secondary: Deep greens, teals (jungle, ocean)
Accent: Bright reds, purples (danger, magic, comedy)
Shadows: Deep blue-purples (not black)
Highlights: Warm cream, pale yellow (not white)
```

## Notes for Tank's Great Adventure Specifically

### Tank's Visual Comedy
- Exaggerate her muscles but keep her face friendly/innocent
- Her confused expressions are key to the humor
- When "on fire" (Chapter 3), make it cartoonishly absurd

### Pig's Western Vibe
- Cowboy hat is essential for silhouette
- Small glasses give the "smart planner" look
- Workout pants are the comedic detail

### The WOLF
- Should be scary-shaped but comedic in expression
- Drooling when bacon is mentioned
- Dramatic poses like a silent film villain

### German Soldiers
- Classic "bumbling guards" archetype
- Height difference creates visual comedy
- Over-the-top expressions
