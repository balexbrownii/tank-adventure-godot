Two-part puzzle structure: Puzzle A (Find Texas Suitcase) with 3 solutions - rotate tag text (Brains using WordManager), craft new tag with stickers (Brains), rip and force (Brawn +Heat) + fail-forward wrong suitcase baggage jam. Puzzle B (Keep Party Together) with 3 solutions - rope link (Brains), follow deer tapping sounds (Bizarre +Morale), shoulder-barge belt (Brawn +Heat) + fail-forward deer reunion. Created 4 inventory items (DestinationTag, ZipperPull, StickerSheet, SouvenirHat). Created 2 dialogs (SuitcaseChoice, KeepPartyTogether). All scripts compile without errors."

Implemented 3 approach solutions: Brains (full emergency prep - vests, straps, secure items - keep most inventory), Brawn (Tank as human seatbelt - save deer, lose items), Bizarre (calm deer with breathing exercise - best morale). Fail-forward: panic/freeze - survive with 12 plastic spoons, harder start. Full crash sequence with tone shift (Norco-style somber). Cliffhanger ending: TO BE CONTINUED, SEASON 2: BOOK TWO - THE AMAZON AWAKENS tease. Playthrough stats showing Brains/Brawn/Bizarre counts and achievements (MAXIMUM TANK, PIG'S PRIDE, WHAT JUST HAPPENED, PERFECTLY BALANCED). Created CrashPrep dialog with 4 options. All scripts compile without errors. GAME COMPLETE!"
